### Biography
Masayoshi Tomizuka received his B.S. and M.S. from Keio University in 1968 and 1970, respectively. He received his Ph. D. from MIT in 1974, after which he joined the ME Department at UC Berkeley. Here, he served as the Vice Chair of Instruction from Dec. 1989 to Dec. 1991, and as the Vice Chair of graduate studies from Jul. 1995 to Dec. 1996.

He is currently the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley. From 2009 to 2011, he was the Executive Associate Dean for the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley. He also served as Program Director of the Dynamic Systems and Control Program at the National Science Foundation from Sept. 2002 to Dec. 2004.

Prof. Tomizuka's research interests include optimal and adaptive control, digital control, signal processing, motion control, mechatronics and their applications in robotics, manufacturing, data storage devices, vehicles, and human-machine systems.
