## Autonomous Driving

### <a name="id1"></a>Introduction

Our lab is focused on proposing novel methodologies and building corresponding facilities to solve the most challenging practical problems for full stack autonomous driving. We combine conventional control, planning and state estimation methods (optimal/robust control, optimization, graph search, Bayesian filtering, etc.) with state-of-the-art machine learning approaches (reinforcement learning, deep neural network, probabilistic graphical models, etc.) to exploit their advantages, and answer questions including but not limited to:

- How to combine conventional and learning-based methodologies for computationally efficient *planning and control* to achieve theoretical guarantee on stability, feasibility and safety, as well as flexibility to learn from trials and data?

- How to enable *decision-making and planning* under uncertainty with social interactions to achieve non-conservatively defensive driving strategies and persuade others to behave as we expected?

- What are good probabilistic predictions for reactions of other road users given our future decision, and how to provide accurate *probabilistic and reactive predictions* to enable safe decision-making and planning with desirable driving quality in a variety of highly interactive driving scenarios?

- How to fuse the information from multiple sensors to enable robust 3D object *detection and tracking* (with LIDAR and camera) and accurate large-scale *mapping and localization* (with LIDAR, GPS, IMU and camera)?

* <b> Prediction and Behavior Modeling </b><br>
Predicting the probabilistic behavior of others in highly interactive scenarios is one of the most challenging problems for autonomous driving. We propose novel methodologies based on deep neural networks, probabilistic graphical models and inverse reinforcement learning for interactive and probabilistic prediction problems. We also address the fundamental but under-explored aspects in the area of prediction, namely, problem formulation, representation simplification and evaluation metrics. Then we propose to construct a unified framework and fatality-aware benchmark to evaluate a variety of probabilistic reaction prediction algorithms.

* <b> Detection, Tracking, Localization and Mapping</b><br>
We are focused on LIDAR-Camera fusion for 3D object detection and tracking based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for perception with onboard sensors. One of the models we proposed, RoarNet, was ranked **#2 on KITTI benchmark** for 3D car detection when submitted. When the object is partially or even fully occluded and the detection is noisy, we introduce learning-based behavioral prediction models combined with Bayesian filtering to achieve accurate tracking. We also investigate framework and methods to enable large-scale mapping and localization based on LIDAR, GPS, IMU and camera.
