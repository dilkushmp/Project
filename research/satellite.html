    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>Modern satellites depend on accurate knowledge of attitude (rotational
    orientation) for navigation and pointing of antennae, solar panels, and
    scientific equipment. Thus, satellites are equipped with an Attitude
    Determination and Control System (ADCS) to estimate and control the attitude
    of the spacecraft. Normally, an ADCS on the spacecraft consists of relative
    attitude sensors, absolute attitude sensors, actuators and algorithms. Sensors
    on board an ADCS include rate sensors (gyroscopes) and star trackers.
    Recently, due to the improving performance of MEMS sensors, there has been
    increased interest in using MEMS gyroscopes in ADCS systems as replacements
    for fiber-optics gyros, or as complementary sensors. MEMS sensors have
    advantages of being low-cost, light weight, and low power consumption.</p>
    <p>In the case of employing MEMS sensors in ADCS, several challenges arise.
    The noise levels of these sensors are high, and gyroscope bias drifts over
    time. The gyroscope parameters are also sensitive to conditions such as
    temperature and operating voltage. In practice, optimal attitude estimates are
    calculated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) filtering algorithms.</p>
    <p>The aims of this research include the calibration and modeling of an array
    of MEMS gyroscopes, development of estimation algorithms, and use of sensor
    fusion to improve estimation accuracy. Another aim is to built an experimental
    testbed for researching attitude determination and navigation systems. The
    experimental testbed is used for evaluating the developed models and
    methods.</p>
