    <p>The conventional servo writing methods have some disadvantages. They need
    expensive external devices for positioning of the write head to write the
    servo patterns and require clean room environment not to contaminate the disk
    drive interior. Furthermore, frequent calibrations may be required. They face
    increasingly difficult challenges as the move towards ever increasing Track
    Per Inch (TPI) continues in the industry. These challenges come from different
    factors. Firstly, conventional servo writing requires several revolutions of
    the spindle to create one servo track. Therefore, the total time required to
    servo write an HDD increases proportionately with increasing number of tracks
    per surface. Because of this decrease in the throughput of servo writing, more
    servo writers are required to meet the production target. This in turn,
    requires more floor space in clean room. Secondly, for drives of smaller form
    factors, the jigs and fixtures for servo writing become smaller. It is
    challenging to design the pushpin mechanism that is small and yet sufficiently
    stiff.</p>
    <p>The demand for higher throughput without increasing the production cost and
    process time was primary motivation for developing an alternative method of
    writing servo patterns called Self ServoWriting (SSW) which can be performed
    in an area outside expensive clean room as this method does not require any
    opening on the HDD's enclosure. SSW has been attractive in HDD industries
    because it not only potentially saves in the cost and time of mass
    manufacturing, but also effectively maintains the servo writing quality. SSW
    regenerates timing (tangential) and position (radial) information from the
    previously written track using the existing GMR head of the HDD itself. Hence,
    the external servo writers are no longer needed and servo writing does not
    have to be processed in the clean-room environment.</p>
    <p>The servo system in SSW involves two control loops: position control loop
    timing control loop. In the position control loop, a Voice Coil Motor (VCM) is
    controlled to maintain the heads over the target track centerline during the
    reading and writing operations. And in the timing control loop, a Phase Lock
    Loop (PLL) is generally used to generate the servo writing clock signal.
    Therefore, there are two critical control objectives in SSW process with
    desired accuracy:</p>
    <p class="indent">1. All the servo tracks must be perfectly concentric. If not
    so, the data tracks will be squeezed, resulting in loss of off-track read
    margin or AC track squeeze. In the position control loop,the position of the
    write head with respect to the track centerline is controlled by controlling
    the VCM. Any disturbance and eccentricity present during this process will
    appear as written-in Repeatable Run-Out (RRO) for the head positioning
    servomechanism of HDD. This written-in RRO increases TMR that must be
    compensated for by the servomechanism of an operational HDD. Naturally, the
    requirements on the accuracy in positioning the write head is more stringent
    in SSW than in HDD servo system.</p>
    <p class="indent">2. The servo sectors of any track must be written perfectly
    radially aligned (radially coherent) with those in the adjacent tracks. If not
    so, reading of servo data will be degraded or corrupted. In the SSW process,
    this is done by controlling a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) to generate the clock
    signal to write the timing marks in the servo patterns. The misalignment
    between the written timing marks and the desired timing marks can be measured
    by timing jitter. Excessive timing jitter causes distortion in read back
    signal and warping of the servo sectors.</p>
