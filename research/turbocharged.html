	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	<p>Due to ever-growing concerns about the depletion of the world's oil supply,
	a critical area of development in the automotive industry is the improvement
	of fuel efficiency in commercial vehicles. Turbocharging a downsized (smaller)
	engine has emerged as an effective method of reducing fuel consumption with
	minimal sacrifices to performance. This method also offers the benefits of
	lower manufacturing and maintenance costs compared to other fuel efficient
	schemes (e.g. electric or hybrid vehicles).</p>
	<p>However, forced induction presents some interesting estimation and control
	problems, since the air dynamics of a turbocharged setup are significantly
	more complex than a naturally aspirated setup. Additional control valves are
	also needed in order to maintain the intake/exhaust manifold pressures in
	their respective desired operating ranges. Furthermore, strict emissions
	standards require the use of exhaust gas recirculation and variable valve
	timing, introducing even more control variables and further complicating the
	system dynamics.</p>
	<p>It is important to inject the appropriate amount of fuel into the
	combustion chamber for a stoichiometric mixture with the air; too much fuel
	increases fuel consumption, too little fuel can cause damage to the engine,
	and deviations either way result in undesirable emissions. A time-delayed
	air/fuel ratio measurement requires most of the fuel control to be done in
	feed forward. Thus, accurate estimation of the mass of air entering the
	combustion chamber is crucial. Controlling this quantity is also necessary for
	torque control, particularly in the case of tracking a transient torque
	profile.</p>
