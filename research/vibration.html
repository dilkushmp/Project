    <h3 id="audio">Adaptive Audio-Vibration Rejection</h3>
    <p>With the ever increasing demand of HDD applications in multimedia
    environments, external vibrations generated from sounds and environments are
    becoming a dominating source of the position error signal (PES) in various HDD
    products. These audio vibrations from, e.g., the computer/TV speakers,
    contaminate the HDD servo performance by introducing strong and wide peaks to
    the PES spectrum. Such band-limited disturbances (disturbances whose spectrum
    are largely contained in multiple narrow or wide bands) differ in products and
    can additionally be time dependent. This research aims at designing an
    adaptive feedback control algorithm (without using additional sensors) for
    audio-vibration compensation.</p>

    <h3 id="multiple">Adaptive Compensation for Multiple Narrow-Band
    Disturbances</h3>
    <p>Narrow-band disturbances show up as spikes in the PES spectrum (see one
    example in Fig. 1). The sources of the narrow-band disturbances in HDD include
    track eccentricity (or repeatable runout), disk modes, and external
    vibrations. Since the frequencies of the narrow-band disturbances are often
    unknown, adaptive control is required for effective rejection of the
    disturbances. We have developed indirect and direct adaptive control schemes
    to compensate for single and multiple narrow-band disturbances to improve the
    servo performance in track following.</p>

    <p>Advantages of the proposed compensation include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it requires the minimal amount of adaptation parameters</li>
        <li>it optimally rejects multiple spectral peaks</li>
        <li>it is a flexible loop-shaping tool that maintain the achieved baseline
        servo performance and can reject vibrations much at frequencies higher than
        the bandwidth of the servo loop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The deterministic case of the algorithm has also been successfully verified
    via experiments on a laboratory setup of an industrial wafer-stage system and
    a variable-gear-ratio based electrical power steering system.</p>
