	<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
	<p>As robotic devices are becoming more ubiquitous in the modern world,
	human-robot interaction is becoming a necessity. Human muscleâ€™s natural
	stiffness varies in different task scenarios. This biological feature
	motivates the development of a compliant actuator with adjustable stiness to
	ensure the safety and comfort of human users while maintaining performance. In
	other words, Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) and the corresponding
	intelligent control are desired to provide the flexibility by changing their
	compliance to suit the variable tasks given.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="setup">Experimental Setup</h3>
	<p>To perform this research, we have constructed a test rig capable of
	accurately measuring the position and torque of a VSA device. Using this setup
	we can test both the static and dynamic properties of such devices. The test
	device itself comprises of a set of standardized mounting brackets, to which
	high resolution optical indexing encoders are mounted. Motor control and data
	acquisition are performed using a real-time operating system.</p>

	<h3 id="design">A Proposed VSA Design</h3>
	<p>One of the designs we are currently investigating uses a variable length
	fulcrum to change the effective stiness of two linear springs. By varying the
	positions of these two springs, the eective rotational joint stiness of the
	series elastic actuator can be changed continuously allowing for the dynamic
	properties to be tuned to suit the desired application.</p>

	<h3 id="control">Control Strategy</h3>
	<p>We are currently investigating a hybrid system control strategy that ts the
	inherent characteristics of such devices and applications involving the
	stiness changes. In a hybrid framework, the dynamics of each mode will be
	characterized for each task segmentation and a set of dierent controllers will
	be synthesized to provide optimal performance. By varying actuator stiness,
	the system dynamics can be altered at a mechanical level, requiring the hybrid
	feedforward/feedback controllers with adaptation capabilities to be properly
	realized and switched for each segment.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="app">Potential Applications</h3>
	<p>By varying the stiffness of an actuator, we are able to protect both the
	actuator and interfacing devices by allowing for exibility in their movements.
	This can be of use in human assistive devices where it is important to not
	apply impulse loads to the user. These devices can also be used to tune the
	resonance of a device which stores /dissipates energy.</p>
