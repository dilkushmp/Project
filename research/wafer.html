  <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
  <p>Photolithography is a critical step in the manufacture of integrated
  circuits (ICs). In the process of photolithography, a pattern is transferred
  from a photomask (reticle) to a chemical photoresist coating a silicon wafer
  by shining a light source through the pattern. The pattern is later engraved
  into the resist through chemical etching. This process is repeated to create
  the circuit layer by layer.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve small feature sizes for ICs, it is important to have
  high precision control of the wafer stage. This research focuses on improving
  the mechanical performance of the wafer stage through developing innovative
  control strategies, modeling methods, and metrology solutions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 id="setup">Experimental Setup</h3>
  <p>A single-axis wafer scanner setup is available at our lab for experiments.
  The system consists of a stage and counter mass, both driven by linear
  permanent magnet motors (LPMM). The stage is mounted on air-bearings,
  resulting in extremely low friction. The system is equipped with sensors such
  as encoder, accelerometers, and a laser interferometry system.</p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="wafer stage" height="320" src="../assets/images/research/waferstage.jpg"
  width="400"></p>
  <p>The system is controlled by a combination of LabVIEW Real-Time and FPGA.
  The FPGA interfaces with the stage actuators and measurement systems and
  provides accurate timing for Real-Time control. The Real-Time system runs the
  stage control algorithms and data logging operations. The LabVIEW development
  environment enables users to quickly design, implement and analyze control
  strategies.</p>

  <h3 id="topics">Research Topics</h3>
  <p><strong>Input Shaping</strong></p>
  <p>Small positioning errors, suppression of vibration, and small settling
  times are some performance requirements for the wafer stage. This research
  investigates the use of input shaping techniques to reduce residual vibration
  while preserving fast settling time. Methods such as low-pass filtering,
  jerk-limited profiles, and input shaping will be applied. Mixed time-frequency
  constrained optimization techniques will be used to generate trajectories with
  minimum settling time, and limited frequency bandwidth to prevent residual
  vibrations.</p>
  <p><strong>Force Ripple Compensation</strong></p>
  <p>Linear permanent magnet motors have found widespread application in
  precision positioning. However, the force ripples which are caused by
  irregular magnetic field and varience of winding self-inductance between the
  premanent magnets and the translator can cause significant tracking errors. A
  composite controller is proposed which consists of PID feedback controller and
  an adaptive feedforward compensator.</p>
  <p><strong>Iterative Learning Control</strong></p>
  <p>Considering the repetitive nature of scanning, ILC has been used
  extensively for improving trajectory tracking and repetitive disturbance
  rejection in wafer scanners. ILC uses information from previous trials of a
  process to reject periodic disturbances iteratively. We implemented a simple
  P-type ILC algorithm for wafer stage control. It is especially attractive
  because of its simple design and implementation.</p>
  <p><strong>Automatic Tuning Techniques</strong></p>
  <p>Every wafer stage has slightly different plant and disturbance model
  characteristics, necessitating fine-tuning of controllers for each wafer
  stage. One of our research aims is to develop techniques to automate the
  iterative process of controller tuning. Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) is
  being investigated as a method for tuning. The automation of controller tuning
  will simplify the installation of new machines in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>Two-axis Synchronization</strong></p>
  <p>In modern wafer scanner setups, both the wafer and reticle are scanned in
  opposite directions to increase the scanning resolution. The movement of the
  wafer and reticle stages must be synchronized to avoid alignment errors. Areas
  of investigation include modeling the cross-coupling between the stages,
  synchronization, and MIMO control.</p>
